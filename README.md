# LinesCounter
Ever wondered how big your coding masterpiece has become, but dread the thought of manually counting lines? Fear not, because LinesCounter is here to save the day! ðŸš€

LinesCounter is a nifty command-line tool meticulously crafted to help you gauge the size of your project's codebase, without breaking a sweat. Whether you're neck-deep in Python, sailing through C#, soaring with JavaScript, etc. LinesCounter effortlessly counts lines of code, making your life as a developer a whole lot easier.
With just a few clicks and even less seconds, it swoops through your project directory and sub-directories, crunches the numbers, and presents you with an insightful report.

# Features
- Counts lines of code in files of specified types (e.g: .py, .cs, .js) within a given directory and all its sub-directories.
- Counts both total lines number and non-empty lines number for each file and whole project.
- Generates a detailed report in a user-friendly format.
- Saves the information in a file named Lines_of_Code_Report.txt.
